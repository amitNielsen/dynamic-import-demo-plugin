# Dynamic Imports Example Plugin

**Attention: Dynamic plugins are a work-in-progress feature. Please do try it out and give feedback, but use only at your own risk!**

This project is meant to be used as a template to create your own Chart Plugins for Superset.

## Initializing Your Own Plugin

For now, you can fork this project to get started. Delete the `.git` folder and run `git init` if you want a clean commit history.

In the future we plan on adding a Yeoman script, and potentially moving portions of this code into a library to make plugin development simpler.

## Developing Your Plugin

To build the plugin:

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

Superset will need to load your built plugin bundle from somewhere. You can temporarily serve the plugin locally using the following command:

```shell
npm run serve
```

Use the "Custom Plugins" menu in Superset to make Superset aware of your plugin.

To build for production:

```shell
npm run build:prod
```
